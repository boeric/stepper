## Stepper

**Stepper** is a React component that allows an end-user to step thorough a sequence of pages (for example filling out a questionnaire).

The configuration of the **Stepper** is completely data-driven. The React parent component that uses **Stepper** provides a data structure that defines which controls should appear on each **Stepper** page. Currently four types of controls are supported:
- **select** (a control using the `select` element)
- **radio** (a control consisting of a group of `radio` buttons)
- **alt-radio** (a group of `button` elements that behaves as `radio`buttons
- **textarea** (a control using a `textarea` element)
- Further input control types can easily be added

The configuration data structure contains a **`pages`** array. Each element in the array specifies the content of each **Stepper** page. Multiple controls can be placed on each **Stepper** page. Aside from the configuaration information for a control, there is also the `name` property. The **Stepper** will use this `name` property and associated control value to format the payload provided to the parent when the user clicks **Submit**.

**TODO**: Support **required** fields (and disallow page advance and submission until the required fields are updated)

Example **Screenshots** from **Stepper**:

Example **Output** provided by the **Stepper**:
```
[
  {
    "likely-to-recommend": 3
  },
  {
    "visit-objective": "Contact customer service"
  },
  {
    "product-of-interest": "Sneakers"
  },
  {
    "easy-to-accomplish-goal": "Difficult"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "This is free form feedback"
  }
]
```


The project's **code style is very strict** (uses the Airbnb eslint standard) 

The project is build from my React template: https://github.com/boeric/zero-config-react-webapp, which enables by default a number of modern Javascript features
